# What is System Design

Set of requirements
- Decide architecture
- Decide components
- Decide modules

↑ How they interact with each other → *To solve the problem* → that is almost → "Product Development"

**Why is it so popular?**

* Every single tech product is a *system* this has been *designed*
* Companies are building products and need you all to design it

**Why understanding system design is important?**

* This is what people do at work
* Everything is practical
* You can see it from Day 1 of joining the company
* Once you grow in your career you will spend 80% of your time doing this

**Conclusion:**
System design is hence relevant for literally everyone

## Side Effects of System Design

- It makes everything else uninteresting
- You solve **real problems**, not something made up
- Break down problem statement systematically
- Rewires your brain to think in a **structured way**
- By considering all positive cases to deliver a great user experience

## What will we do when we design a system?

- Break down problem statement into solvable subproblems
- Decide on key components and requirements
- Decide on boundaries of each component
- Touch upon key challenges in scaling it
- Make our architecture **fault tolerant** and **available**


## How to approach System Design?

System Design is **extremely practical** and there is a **structured way** to take the situation.

**Take baby steps, no matter what!**

1. **Understand the problem statement**
   
   Without having a thorough understanding of the problem at hand, we would easily digress.

2. **Break it down into components** *(essential)*

**Note:** To start with,

* Do **not** create components for the sake of it.
* Create components that you know are **must-have**.

**Example:** *Design Facebook*

**Components / Features:** when problem statement is too big

* Auth
* Notification
* Feed
* Gamification
